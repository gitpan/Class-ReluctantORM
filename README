Class-ReluctantORM-0.5

"An ORM your DBA can live with, sort of"

This is an ORM that discourages making hidden database calls by forcing
the developer to pre-fetch as much as possible.  That may be a net win or a net loss 
in your situation.  Instead of having lots of tiny round-trips, you'll now tend to 
have a few high-join-count queries.

CRO has full support for has-one, has-many, and has-many-many relationships.  It has 
an excellent event-based system to observe the translation of API calls into SQL, 
which can be used to monitor for ORM abuse.

It is immature in some areas.  It has some memory leak issues.  It has strong 
PostgreSQL support, but weak support for all others; the driver system is
extensible, should anyone feel inspired.

TESTING

During installation, CRO would like to use a real database to test with.  'make test' 
will interactively prompt you for info, or you can set envirnment variables:

 CRO_DB_MODE - (s) skip all, (d) from DBI DSN, (g) generate a local database
   If you choose s, you're done.
   If you choose d, also set CRO_DB_DSN, CRO_DB_USERNAME, CRO_DB_PASSWORD.  DSN format is that used by DBI.
   If you choose g, also set CRO_DB_RDBMS to one of: 
     p for PostgreSQL (must have local server installed, but need not be running)
     s for sqlite

This information is cached across multiple test runs in t/test.dsn .  If you generated a database, you'll 
also need to delete t/test-db-initted.flag if you want it to regenerate.

If you want to keep the database running after testing,
      Set CRO_DB_KEEP_RUNNING=1
otherwise t/Z99-shutdown.t will shutdown the test database cluster.
