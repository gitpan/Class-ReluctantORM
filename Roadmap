What's Next for CRO?

Short-Term
 * the test-database setup thing makes me want to stab my past self
 * MySQL support.  Do people still use that?
 * sqlite support that isn't just a smelly pile of brokenness
 * Probably some way of splitting queries that have multiple has-many relations prefetched to avoid combinatorial explosions in the number of rows returned.  We handle it "correctly", but slowly.
 * A less facepalmy SchemaCache system; like imagine if you could generate a schema file and modify it, in perl.  I wonder if anyone has done that.
 * A global option to turn off reluctance in production, or at least downgrade "throwing an exception" to "emitting a warning to the log"
 * Memory Leak hunt continues

Long-Term
 * why does this exist
 * couldn't it just be a wrapper around DBIx::Class, or some kind of plugin to it
 * might be fun to do this in Ruby
   * what am I thinking writing an ORM was a horrible nightmare, everyone was right
   * I should go to law school
